- 8-Bit RPG Adventure Music Pack by Chris Kohler -

Thank you for downloading this music pack!

How to use this pack?
All loop audio tracks are already cut to loop seamlessly. You can immeditely insert them into your game engine. I recommend using the WAV files for the optimal quality. The OGG files are compressed, but will use less storage space.

If you have any questions or issues with the music pack don't hesitate to contact me. I am also available to compose custom music for your game.

If you enjoyed the music pack, please consider leaving a positive review.

I wish you great success with your game project!

Best wishes,
Chris Kohler
